# semeval2024-task6-hallucination-detection

This paper describes our submission for SemEval-2024 Task 6: SHROOM, a Shared-task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes, and we join both model-agnostic and model-aware tracks. We ensemble different methods, which significantly enhances the generalization capability. Our method's effectiveness is validated by our high rankings - 3rd in the model-agnostic track and 5th in the model-aware track.
